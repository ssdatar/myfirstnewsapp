# Civic Art in San Francisco
This app has been made as part of course work for Computational Journalism (COMM 277A). It takes the [data from the San Francisco Open Data portal](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/SF-Civic-Art-Collection/zfw6-95su) and displays it on a map.

## Wide view
This is the landing page view that tells users how many art pieces there are in the city, who has made them, when they made it, and what material it is made of.

## Detail view
Each artist name in the table links to an individual page for that piece. The page has a Street View of the piece, which has been pulled in using Google's Street View API. Sometimes, users may have to move their view to see the piece. Sometimes the API doesn't have the art piece available in the view.

But overall, it still gives a pretty decent view (pun unintended) of the civic art pieces of San Francisco.
